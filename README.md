handlebars-helpers
==============

These are a collection of general Handlebars helpers I have made for some projects.  If you don't like them, I invite you to contribute or file an issue.

##iff

I have this one to be especially convenient.

Note:  IFF more or less goes against one of the fundamental principles of Handlebars.  Please refrain from bitching about it.

##money

Converts something like ```123.1``` to ```$123.10```, with an option to not use cents.

Note:  This is only USD, as again these are helpers that I use often.  Feel free to make a pull request if you want to handle other currency.

Note2:  When I made this, I had a tight deadline to complete a lot of things, and since all that was expected of me was to add dollar signs in front of text, my management wouldn't have understood my taking tons of time on this helper.  Thus the code is inefficient and pretty much thrown together.  If I'm in an opportunity where it's relevant, I will likely improve it.

##log

This is so simple, and yet obviously useful.

Note:  If memory/laziness serve, it only logs one argument.  This is something else I will improve when the need arises.

Let me know what you think!  Or leave me alone.
